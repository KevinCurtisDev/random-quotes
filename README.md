# Random Quotation Generator

## Summary

This is a browser based random quote generator built with JavaScript for the treehouse full stack JavaScript tech degree.

The idea of the project is to allow a user to click the generate quote button, which will pull a random quote from an array of premade quotes and display them in the dom. If the user doesn't click the button, random quotes will automatically get generated and displayed in the dom every 10 seconds.

## Features

The random quote generator automatically generates a random quote every 10 seconds. The user can also manually create a random quote by clicking on the generate quote button. Each quote displays a quote, a source, a citation if it exists, a date if known, and a category. As each new quote is generated, the screen's background colour will also change.
